Muslims abstain from not only food, drink, and sex, but also from lying, cheating, gossiping, swearing, and other bad behaviors. Muslims also engage in prayers to varying extents, according to each individual’s capability.\r\n\r\nIslam encourages adherents to maintain positive Ramadan habits throughout the year. \r\nThe prophet Muhammad recommended loving, sharing, and caring for others. “Wish for your brother what you would wish for yourself,” he said in a famous hadith. \r\n\r\nIslam considers charity to be valuable work that enables Muslims to empathize with the suffering of others. This spiritual work requires reflection and a show of compassion. \r\n\r\nThe Quran instructs capable individuals to give part of their wealth and food to others. “Spend out of that in which He has made you successors. For those who have believed among you and spent, there will be a great reward,” reads the seventh verse of chapter 57. \r\n\r\nMuslims give through the principle of Zakat al-Fitra during Ramadan, a charitable contribution that worshippers who have an excess of food must make before the end of the holy month so that those in need can eat during the Eid celebration. Flour or other food staples are sometimes offered in lieu of money. ', '2020-04-24'),

We need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://copyblogger.com/schedule-creative-time/\" target=\"_blank\">prepare for distractions</a>, because creativity is distracting. ????</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides unanticipated interruptions during our work sessions, there are typical creative circumstances that we can anticipate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always get new ideas when I&rsquo;m in work mode. Always. And most of the time they don&rsquo;t fit into the article I&rsquo;m currently writing or editing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nonetheless, I need to stop what I&rsquo;m doing and explore my thoughts a bit, so I have something substantial to revisit when I&rsquo;m ready to use that topic.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Step #2: Have fun</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Having fun is an underutilized editing tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you only have time to take breaks during your editorial review if you &hellip; leave enough time to have fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRxxF4DhJU0\" target=\"_blank\">24-hour rule for better writing</a>. Essentially, after you finish writing a draft, you wait 24 hours before you edit it. This way, you&rsquo;ll have fresh eyes and catch more mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can use the 24-hour rule within your creative self-editing process as well &mdash; it&rsquo;s not just for catching mistakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taking breaks to do something fun, unrelated to your writing and editing, gives you space to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://copyblogger.com/content-success/\" target=\"_blank\">make new connections</a>&nbsp;that add depth and nuance to rough ideas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It may sound counterintuitive, but many important messages for your audience will emerge when you&rsquo;re not concerned about writing an important message.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2020-08-13');
